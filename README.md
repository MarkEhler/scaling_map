# scaling_map
A matrix manipulation practice

The assigned task was to take the a code sample that creates randomly colored states and colors each differently according to an "adjacency list" a feature given to each state.

Thinking of a map as a matrix is the key to scaling this problem.  the goal is to input fairly vauge features associated with each landmark (countries in this case) and order then in a fixed way so that a function could iterate over the list and assign adjacencies for the original code to handle.

This project is largely pseudo code once the matrix is established but finishing would require fairly simple keys off the proposed matrix and mapping those back to a new feature in the dataframe.
